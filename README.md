ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Dashboard
ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard 
ðŸ§© Problem Statement
This dashboard helps academic institutions and educators analyze and track student performance across different departments and academic years. It provides valuable insights into how students are performing in core subjects such as Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Programming, and more, and helps identify areas that need attention.

Through interactive visuals and filters, this dashboard allows users to:

Explore department-wise and year-wise performance trends

Identify high-performing and underperforming subjects

Analyze overall student performance distribution

Pinpoint areas of improvement for academic planning

Since certain departments or subjects may show consistently lower performance, educators can use these insights to revise teaching strategies, conduct remedial sessions, or redesign curriculum focus.

Also, by having access to anonymized or sample academic data, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to improve student outcomes.
